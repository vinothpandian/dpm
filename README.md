#Doctor Patient Drugstore Management blockchain

The project is composed of two parts : A mobile app for users and a Back-end system

It is a blockchain-based system that aims to end medical prescriptions' fraud. The doctors would write the prescriptions on the blockchain, these encrypted information can then be checked by the drugstores to verify the authenticity of the prescription.

The project was developed during the LauzHack 2017 hackathon @EPFL, Switzerland. The project won the Bloomberg price at that hackathon.
